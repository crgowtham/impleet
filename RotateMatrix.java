/*
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

 

Example 1:


Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]

The most elegant solution for rotating the matrix is to firstly reverse the matrix around the main diagonal, and then reverse it from left to right.
These operations are called transpose and reflect in linear algebra.
